PROBLEM STATEMENT
Create a design that gathers vehicle data (like location, speed, engine status) in real time, processes it, and provides actionable insights for fleet management. Think about handling high-frequency data streams and ensuring low-latency analytics.


High-Level Overview:

Objective: Build a system that can receive data from many IoT devices, perform basic validation and processing on the incoming data, and then store it for later retrieval or further analysis.
Core Functional Components:
Device & Data Generation: Simulate devices sending data (e.g., sensor readings).
Ingestion Service: Receive the data, perform simple validation, and pass it along.
Message Buffer/Queue: Temporarily hold messages between ingestion and processing. This decouples the input from the processing logic.
Processing Engine: Process or transform incoming messages (for example, by adding simple enrichment).
Storage Service: Store the processed data so it can be retrieved later.
Step-by-Step Approach:

Step 1: Explain the data flow: devices send data to the ingestion service, which puts messages into a message queue. The processing engine pulls messages from the queue, does any necessary processing, and then sends the data to a storage service.
Step 2: Identify the key objects and their responsibilities:
Device: Represents an IoT device that generates data.
Message: Represents a data payload from a device.
IngestionService: Receives and validates data, then enqueues it.
MessageQueue: Acts as a buffer between ingestion and processing.
ProcessingEngine: Retrieves messages from the queue, processes them (for example, by enriching the data), and forwards them to storage.
StorageService: Stores the processed data.
Step 3: Implement a simple object-oriented design (OOD) in Python to model these components and demonstrate their interaction.
Step 4: Walk through the code, explaining how each class and function contributes to the overall functionality.
Functional Clarification Questions:

Data Flow: "For this exercise, should we assume that the devices just send a simple sensor reading (like temperature) along with a timestamp?"
Validation: "Do we need to implement any specific validation rules on the incoming data, or is basic presence checking enough?"
Processing: "Should the processing step simply enrich the data with a status flag (for instance, labeling a reading as 'normal' or 'alert')?"
Storage: "For storage, is it sufficient to simulate it with an in-memory data structure, or should we implement a simple interface that mimics a database?"
Interactive Implementation:

I’ll start by describing each class, its methods, and the overall data flow.
Then, I’ll write the Python code that demonstrates how devices generate data, how the ingestion service validates and enqueues it, how the processing engine processes the messages, and finally how the storage service saves the data.
Throughout, I’ll ask if we need to adjust or add any additional functionality.
